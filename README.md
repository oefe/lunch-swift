# lunch-swift

Lunch ordering tracker for iOS.

In my office, we have a canteen that requires that you order your lunch one week in advance.

This is an iOS app which lets me keep track for which days I have ordered lunch.

It is a port from the original [Pythonista][1] version, which you find in the [lunch][2] project
